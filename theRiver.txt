verse
the just keeps on turning
as day turns into night
she swore that she would follow him 
and love him the rest of her life

then their two worlds were as one
with the joining of their hands
sharng love in the fairy tale world
of golden wedding bands

chorus
like the stream flows on and on - unending
as if time had just begun - they are spending
lives and dreams that flow into the sea
and the river rushes on

verse
She gave birth to a son
fair skinned with golden hair
the image of his father
the precious fruit of the love they shared

he grew into a man 
and did as men must do
he found a girl and fell in love
they had a young son too
