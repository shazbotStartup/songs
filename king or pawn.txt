verse
We kissed in sea breezes in Georgia
and you promised that you would be mine
not for a few sweet hours 
but until the end of time

You said lets run away with each other
under Colorado's blue skies
We can the settle down together
and share the best part of our lives.

chorus
Is it really going to happen
or are you just leadng me on
Am I your precious king
or just another pawn
When the curtain  finally opens 
what truth will be revealed
a life of love and happiness
or a bloody battlefield

verse
You said we could be equal partners
and put all differences aside
but when push came to shove you withheld your love
and brushed my desires aside

I don't really understand it
and I feel I deserve to know why
when our love is not working its disconcerting
What inspired your desire to defy

bridge
angry words once spoken
can never be taken back
fragile hearts nearly broken
may remain forever cracked
